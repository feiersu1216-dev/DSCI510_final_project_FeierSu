# DSCI510_finalproject

This project analyzes KPOP physical album sales data to explore patterns and correlations related to parent companies, group types, and other numerical factors. The analysis includes data collection and cleaning, statistical testings, and visualizations of correlation and sales distributions. Due to limited data base, some missing values that could not be found were remained as blanks.

The codes were origianlly run by Colab and then modified to better be served in Github.
